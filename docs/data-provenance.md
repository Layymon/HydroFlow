# Data provenance

## Approved starting source

HydroFlow V1 may import the existing file:

`D:\Ai_Project\Hydroflow\data\processed\daily.csv`

That source was assembled from:

- Bago Region relief workbooks used to mark reported flood days.
- Open-Meteo historical/reanalysis rainfall.
- GloFAS modeled river discharge through the Open-Meteo Flood API.

Live model outlooks use Open-Meteo forecast rainfall and GloFAS modeled
forecast discharge. NASA POWER is queried only for retrospective weather
charts; its soil wetness and humidity fields were removed from V2 model inputs
because they are not reliably available for future dates. OpenTopography
Copernicus GLO-30 supplies display-only elevation. API keys live in `.env` and
are not written into source, logs, or responses. Route ordering uses Kardinal.

The approved source is copied into the immutable `data/raw/` location and is
validated before feature generation.

## 2024 census reference

`data/2024_census_bago_report (update).xlsx` is the Bago Region extract used
as the population base. `data/external/bago_census_2024.json` is the structured
copy the API serves. It keeps the published counts for:

- region, district, and township population by sex
- urban and rural residence where the workbook publishes it
- age groups for the region and each district
- household size and dwelling type as the living situation

Age groups are not published for individual townships. These counts are not
flood-model inputs.

## Interpretation limits

- A positive label means a flood day represented in available relief records.
  It is not a complete hydrological flood inventory.
- Rainfall is reanalysis data rather than a local rain-gauge measurement.
- River discharge is modeled GloFAS discharge, not measured gauge height.
- Copernicus GLO-30 elevation is a digital surface model on the EGM2008 geoid.
  It includes canopy and buildings, and it is not a flood-model input.
- Sparse relief impact fields must not be treated as complete observations.
- Synthetic data from older demo projects is not an approved real-data source.

All model and dashboard outputs must remain labeled as academic prototype
results unless independent validation establishes operational reliability.
